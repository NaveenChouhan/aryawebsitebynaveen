        <div class="ab1">PRESIDENT MESSAGE</div>
        <div>
            <p class="ab2">When students graduate from school, their entry into the world should be so smooth that nary
                a ripple should mar the transition from adolescence to adulthood; it should be so impactful that it
                touches the lives of multitudes; and it should be so unique that it remains etched in the minds of those
                who revelled in it. This is the dream that we at ABBPS have for our students. We want to prepare them so
                that they can face challenges with aplomb and accept success with humility. We want them to experience
                the real joy of living not just obtain a vicarious knowledge of it through books. We want them to be
                known as honourable players and not just winners, as wise and not just intelligent, as understanding and
                not just knowledgeable, as kind and compassionate and not just friendly. Life at ABBPS is an exciting
                journey which begins when children enter its portals and step into the intricate domain of the scholar.
                Along with mastery of the various areas of academics, we encourage them to enjoy and excel in sports and
                other co-curricular activities. They are guided to learn the art of governance by organising events and
                donning the mantle of student leaders. They are taught to be independent in thought, but to act within
                the framework of decorum and respect for others. We applaud those high achievers who bring fame to the
                school with their achievements in scholastic and non-scholastic areas. But it is those students who
                embody the values of selflessness, tolerance, honesty and integrity who are remembered much after they
                have left school and who leave an indelible imprint in the annals of the history of the school for they
                have chosen a far more arduous path to follow; one of self-discipline, which is replete with principles
                an ordinary person may find difficult to follow. This is who a true Dipsite is: A student who has the
                ability to triumph in any field he chooses and whose exemplary values place him far above the others in
                his area of expertise. It matters that the alumni of ABBPS become trailblazers and that our students
                bring laurels to the school, but what matters more is that they be good human beings. I conclude with a
                message for my students: Whatever is done must be done with passion for only in that lies perfection.
                Never let fear or embarrassment keep you from participating in activities that interest you for it is
                only in school that you can actually discover your hidden talents and find the real you. The deepest
                regret in life is always for not doing what you wanted to. Let that not become a part of you. Also never
                betray the trust of someone for that is the most fragile and precious bond of all. Once broken, it can
                never be salvaged. Above all, never get so involved in what you are doing that you forget to enjoy
                yourselves. The secret of your success lies in your own happiness and wellbeing. </p>
