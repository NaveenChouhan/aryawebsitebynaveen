                <p>When students graduate from school, their entry into the world should be so smooth that nary a ripple
                    should mar the transition from adolescence to adulthood; it should be so impactful that it touches
                    the lives of multitudes; and it should be so unique that it remains etched in the minds of those who
                    revelled in it. This is the dream that we at ABBPS have for our students. We want to prepare them so
                    that they can face challenges with aplomb and accept success with humility. We want them to
                    experience the real joy of living not just obtain a vicarious knowledge of it through books. We want
                    them to be known as honourable players and not just winners, as wise and not just intelligent, as
                    understanding and not just knowledgeable, as kind and compassionate and not just friendly. When
